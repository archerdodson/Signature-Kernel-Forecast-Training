Saved Models and Training Regimes for final WeatherBench Training. Results for the signature kernel score were taken from these experiments. 

Files are denoted by Weather, E3 for three ensemble members, P# for path length, and ES for energy score, default is signature kernel. Lat denotes the exceptionally scaled by longitude, latitude weighted experiments. Lat2 denotes extra scaling with RBF static kernel sigma of 2. LatTest includes path length scaling. Sigma2 is the standard latitude weighting sigma of 2. Sigma is the standard latitude weighting with sigma of 10.
